	<b><h2>What do you think web design and development is about? </h2></b>
	<p> I think web disign and development is a very interesting and meaningful thing to learn and practice. It is not only a way to show you thinking in a specific way, but also to impact the others 
	to accomplish a certain goal, such as marketing, environmental protection and so on. It is a technical and artistical thing. You need to find a effective way to enjoy and attract your aiming customers.
	</p>
	<b><h2>How important do you think web design and development is in today's digital world? </h2></b>
	<p> It is very important to the digital world, because it is the wide-using way for people to see the world and communicate with others. Internet can impact massive people widely and promptly, maybe poitive or
	negative. Web design and development must be in a positive and ethical way in order to establish a better world. It should be focus more on dealing with social problems, keeping neutral in dispute, supplying
	authentical products in trade and pushing people to communicate in a effective and peaceful way together. Nowadays, people can not live without web, so web disigner should take more responsibilities on it.
	</p>
	<b><h2>What aspects of web design and development are you excited to learn about? </h2></b>
	<p> There are too much things I want to learn, because I am so excited to have the opportunity to learn such a interesting course, imaging I can buil my own website after finishing this course. First, I 
	want to learn Html, CSS coding. Secondly, I want to learn web interface design skills, such as UI and UX. Thirdly, I have much interesting in skills in how to attract your customers. Finally, I want to learn
	the ways in how to do the fieldwork, project management, methods in dealing with social problmes such as poverty, environmental pollution, food security and so on.

	<b><h2>If you could master one specific skill in web design and development, what would it be? (e.g., front-end development, UX design, back-end development, etc.) </h2></b>
	<p> I have much interesting in UX design. I think for a website, how it looks like and whether it is easy to understand and use for your users is very important. A good UX design can give the users better experience
	and effective way to achieve their goal on the website. A complex and unacceptable UX design may scare your coustomers and push them away. How to desing your website in a simple way but with enough information that 
	users needed is a skill I want to learn. In addition, you need to do some eye-catching job to attract more users to sign in your website. For internet, promoting volume of users is the first goal.
	</p>

	management system, such as web techonologies. Second, acctually, I want to establish my own website with these skills to open my own trading business. I want to supply a more effective and cheaper way
	to people to buy living products from all over the world, and supplying a platform for people to communicate and exchange private stuffs safely and freely without cost. It is a far goal for me and I will
	try my best to achieve it.
